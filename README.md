# Playing around with PyScript

## just tinkering with some new python toys

src found here:
* https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript

## importing scripts:
chrome doesn't like importing a file from a 'file://' origin so to do the file import test I spun up a super basic server in this directory

open terminal in this dir and:
```
python -m http.server
```
and then import.html's import will work
